# SCI-FI CALC

Sci-Fi Calc is a revolutionary scientific calculator that builds upon the standard calculator and takes it to the next level. This project aims to enhance the functionality of a basic calculator by incorporating advanced features like Inverse Trigonometric functions and Logarithmic functions. All the additional functions are conveniently accessible from the buttons section, making complex calculations a breeze.

- Many other additional functions to enhance the user's experience.

# Pre-requisites
- Sci-Fi Calc should be opened in desktop site for mobiles to be used fluently.
- For desktop page the site is made at 100% page view,so for a good experience make your default page size to 100% .

# Usage
Sci-Fi Calc brings advanced mathematical functions to your fingertips, converting a standard calculator into a powerful scientific calculator. To make the most out of this enhanced tool, follow these usage guidelines:

## Trigonometric Functions
- For using trigonometric functions like sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, and cosec, first enter the desired value, and then press the corresponding function button to obtain the result.

## Inverse Trigonometric Functions
- To calculate the inverse trigonometric functions (sin-1, cos-1, tan-1), input the value and then press the respective function button.

## Exponential Function (x^y)
- To perform the exponentiation operation (x^y), start by entering the base value (x). Then, press the function button "x^y" and provide the exponent value (y)  followed by equal { = } button or {Ans} button to compute the result.

## Special Functions - I
- For the following functions (âˆšx, 1/x, x!), input a number as the value of 'x', and then press the corresponding function followed by equal { = } button or {Ans} button to obtain the calculated result.

## Special Functions - II
- For the following functions ( x^2, x^3 ), input a number as the value of 'x', and then press the corresponding function followed by equal { = } button or {Ans} button to obtain the calculated result.

## logarithmic function
- For the following functions ( ln, log), input a number than press the function

## Brackets Support
- Sci-Fi Calc adheres to the BODMAS rule, allowing you to use parentheses for complex expressions and calculations.

## Power of 10 (10^x)
- To calculate the value of 10 raised to the power of 'x', first enter the value of 'x', then press the "10^x" function button to get the result.

## Nth Root Function (yâˆšx)
- For the nth root function, first enter the value of 'y' (root), then press the "yâˆšx" function button, and finally, provide the value of 'x' followed by equal { = } button or {Ans} button to compute the result.
